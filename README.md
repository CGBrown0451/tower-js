TowerJS is a multiplatform Browser game, with the lead platform being mobile devices, made using Phaser 3 and utilising (navmesh by Mike Westhad)[https://github.com/mikewesthad/navmesh]. Previous versions also used (Zingtouch)[https://github.com/zingchart/zingtouch]. It is a top down shooter where, currently, all you can do is shoot targets (in completed levels).
This game utilises only a pointer to control everything, from the menus to moving your character. My design limitation was that I wanted to use as few onscreen buttons during gameplay as possible, as they generally ruin the experience of mobile games, for me.
